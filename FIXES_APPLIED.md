# Bug Fixes Applied - 2025-10-30

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Import Error: `structlog.INFO` → `logging.INFO`

**Problem:** Used `structlog.INFO` which doesn't exist. Should use `logging.INFO` from the standard library.

**Files Fixed:**
- ✅ `services/llm_client.py` - Added `import logging`, changed `structlog.INFO` to `logging.INFO`
- ✅ `services/search.py` - Added `import logging`, changed `structlog.INFO` to `logging.INFO`
- ✅ `services/scraper.py` - Added `import logging`, changed `structlog.INFO` to `logging.INFO`
- ✅ `services/embedding.py` - Added `import logging`, changed `structlog.INFO` to `logging.INFO`

**Root Cause:** `tenacity.before_sleep_log()` expects standard library log levels, not structlog.

### 2. Import Error: `run_migrations` vs `migrate`

**Problem:** CLI tried to import `run_migrations` but the function is named `migrate`.

**Files Fixed:**
- ✅ `cli.py` line 452 - Changed `from db.migrate import run_migrations` to `from db.migrate import migrate`

## What Still Needs to Be Done

### Critical: Install Dependencies

**YOU MUST RUN THIS FIRST:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs all required packages including:
- typer (CLI framework)
- structlog (logging)
- google-generativeai (Gemini API)
- openai (embeddings)
- And 10+ other dependencies

### Verification Steps

After installing dependencies:

1. **Check installation:**
   ```bash
   python check_setup.py
   ```

2. **Initialize database:**
   ```bash
   python cli.py init
   ```

3. **Verify all imports:**
   ```bash
   python -c "from services import *; from db import *; from pipeline import *; print('✓ All imports successful')"
   ```

## Testing Status

### ❌ No Tests Written Yet

**Lesson Learned:** Should have used `qa-testing-expert` agent during development.

**Next Steps:**
1. Create comprehensive test suite
2. Unit tests for each service
3. Integration tests for pipeline
4. Mock external API calls
5. Achieve >70% code coverage

## Next Session Checklist

When you return to this project:

- [ ] Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [ ] Run `python check_setup.py` to verify installation
- [ ] Run `python cli.py init` to initialize database
- [ ] Set up `.env` file with API keys
- [ ] Create test suite (use qa-testing-expert agent)
- [ ] Run first end-to-end test
- [ ] Fix any additional bugs found during testing

### 3. Method Name Mismatches in Orchestrator

**Problem:** Orchestrator calling non-existent async method names.

**Files Fixed:**
- ✅ `pipeline/orchestrator.py` line 364 - Changed `generate_queries_async()` to `generate_queries()` (sync)
- ✅ `pipeline/orchestrator.py` line 434 - Changed `search_async()` to `search()` (sync)
- ✅ `pipeline/orchestrator.py` line 606 - Changed `extract_events_from_chunks_async()` to `extract_from_chunks()` (async)
- ✅ `pipeline/orchestrator.py` line 856 - Changed `generate_forecast_async()` to `generate_forecast()` (sync)
- ✅ `pipeline/orchestrator.py` line 442 - Fixed SearchResult handling (already objects, not dicts)

**Root Cause:** Method names in implementation didn't match what orchestrator expected.

### 4. DocumentProcessor.chunk_document() Signature Mismatch

**Problem:** Orchestrator passing string instead of Document object to chunk_document().

**Files Fixed:**
- ✅ `pipeline/orchestrator.py` line 604 - Changed `chunk_document(doc.cleaned_content or "", url=doc.url)` to `chunk_document(doc)`

**Root Cause:** Method expects Document object but orchestrator was passing string content with url kwarg.

**Impact:** This prevented EVENT_EXTRACT stage from processing any documents, resulting in 0 events extracted and cascading failure in CLUSTER stage.

## Total Bugs Fixed: 11

All issues resolved! The pipeline should now run without import or method name errors.

Run `python cli.py run "Your question"` to test.
